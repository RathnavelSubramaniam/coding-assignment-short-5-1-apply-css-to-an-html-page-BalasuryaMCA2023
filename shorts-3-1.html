        <p class="p2">
           

Lot of heat but not very much light. It came across as a kind of daytime soap opera versum showing the personalities of the players rather than dealing with the nuts and bolts of what really happened. Even that wild not have been so bad but the movie tries to portray lots of these folks as sympathetic figures just trying to do the right thing<br><br>

Tam watching this for the time trying to understand how this large group of capitalist pigs could royally screw their

families descents, arghhors countrymen and the rest of the whole world with absolutely no compassion<br><br>
